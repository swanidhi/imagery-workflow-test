description: Category onboarding playbook for designing AI imagery prompts for new product categories
---

# How to Use This Workflow

Invoke this workflow when:
- Onboarding a NEW product category (e.g., outdoor gear, apparel, kitchen products)
- Reviewing EXISTING category for responsibility issues
- Designing scene templates for a new class

---

## Step 1: Category Risk Assessment

Answer these questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Is this category regulated? | |
| Are there age restrictions? | |
| Could imagery be misused? (High/Medium/Low) | |
| Are there cultural sensitivities? | |

**Risk Level determines review depth:**
- **High** (firearms, alcohol, pharmaceuticals) → Legal + Brand + Ethics review
- **Medium** (knives, supplements, hunting) → Brand + Ethics review  
- **Low** (apparel, home goods) → Standard design review

## Step 2: Apply "Would You See This?" Test

For each proposed scene context, ask:
> *"Would a real customer realistically encounter this product in this exact situation?"*

❌ Reject contexts that fail this test.

---

## Step 3: Design Evocative Templates

Use this structure:
```
"[Context Type]: [Surface/Setting], [Props nearby], [Lighting], [Atmosphere]"
```

**DO describe:** Context, props, atmosphere, lighting
**DO NOT describe:** Product position, camera angle, frame percentage

## Step 4: Responsibility Checklist

- [ ] Human presence policy defined (None / Hands only / Partial / Full)
- [ ] Category-specific negative prompts identified
- [ ] Each context passes safety audit:
  - Not depicting illegal activity
  - Not normalizing unsafe behavior
  - Would pass brand guidelines

---

## Step 5: Create 5 Templates Per Class

Every class needs at least 5 templates covering:
1. Use Context
2. Storage Context
3. Maintenance Context
4. Lifestyle Context
5. Detail/Hero Context

## Step 6: Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Risk Assessment complete
- [ ] Responsibility Checklist signed off
- [ ] 5+ templates per class

### Gate 2: After 10 Sample Images
- [ ] No unrealistic positions?
- [ ] No responsibility violations?
- [ ] Meaningful diversity?

### Gate 3: Before Production
- [ ] Stakeholder approval
